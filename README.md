College Management System

# 🎓 Apex College Management System

A realistic, role-based **College Management System** built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (ES6)** — no backend, no database, no frameworks like React or Vue. Bootstrap 5 powers the UI, and all data is persisted locally in the browser via **Local Storage**.

The system simulates a real college portal with three distinct user roles — **Admin**, **Staff (Faculty)**, and **Student** — each with their own login, dashboard, permissions, and workflows.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Authentication and authorization in this project are simulated on the client side for demonstration/portfolio purposes. There is no real backend, password hashing, or server-side security. Do not use this as-is for a production system handling real student data.

## ✨ Features

- 🏠 **Warm public landing page** — a real institutional homepage (not just a bare login screen), with hero banner, quick facts, departments, and announcement previews.
- 🔐 **Role-based authentication & authorization** — seeded demo accounts for Admin, Staff, and Student, with route guards that block access to pages outside a user's role.
- 📊 **Three distinct dashboards** — Admin, Staff, and Student each get a dashboard tailored to what they actually need, favoring stat cards and actionable lists over chart-heavy layouts.
- 👨‍🎓 **Student Management (CRUD)** — add, edit, delete, search, sort, and filter student records (Admin: full access · Staff: scoped to their assigned classes).
- 👩‍🏫 **Staff Management (Admin only)** — manage faculty accounts, departments, designations, and subject/class assignments.
- 🗓️ **Attendance Module** — mark and track attendance with automatic percentage calculation; students see a read-only view of their own attendance.
- 📝 **Marks & Grading Module** — subject-wise marks entry with automatic total, average, percentage, and grade calculation (A+ through F); students see a read-only report card.
- 📣 **Announcements / Notice Board** — role-aware notices (All / Staff Only / Students Only audiences).
- 🙍 **Role-aware profile pages** — each role has its own profile layout and a color-coded role badge (Admin, Staff, Student) so it's always clear whose portal you're in.
- ⚙️ **Settings** — password change, avatar/photo update, Dark/Light mode toggle (persisted); Admin-only system branding settings (college name, logo, theme color).
- 🌗 **Dark Mode / Light Mode**, fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile.
